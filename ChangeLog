2017-10-17 v0.92

* Changes to support __all__ caused the CPython module to fail to import at
  runtime on Python 3. This was hidden during testing as the CFFI module was
  successfully imported.


2016-10-17 v0.91

* The docstring for NotFoundError was clarified to indicate that it is
  not raised in normal circumstances.

* CFFI open_db() would always attempt to use a write transaction, even if the
  environment was opened with readonly=True. Now both CPython and CFFI will
  use a read-only transaction in this case. Reported by Github user
  handloomweaver.

* The source distribution previously did not include a LICENSE file, and may
  have included random cached junk from the source tree during build. Reported
  by Thomas Petazzoni.

* Transaction.id() was broken on Python 2.5.

* Repair Travis CI build again.

* CFFI Cursor did not correctly return empty strings for key()/value()/item()
  when iternext()/iterprev() had reached the start/end of the database.
  Detected by tests contributed by Ong Teck Wu.

* The package can now be imported from within a CPython subinterpreter. Fix
  contributed by Vitaly Repin.

* lmdb.tool --delete would not delete keys in some circumstances. Fix
  contributed by Vitaly Repin.

* Calls to Cursor.set_range_dup() could lead to memory corruption due to
  Cursor's idea of the key and value failing to be updated correctly. Reported
  by Michael Lazarev.

* The lmdb.tool copy command now supports a --compact flag. Contributed by
  Achal Dave.

* The lmdb.tool edit command selects the correct database when --delete is
  specified. Contributed by ispequalnp.

* lmdb.tool correctly supports the -r flag to select a read-only environment.
  Contributed by ispequalnp.

* The lmdb.tool --txn_size parameter was removed, as it was never implemented,
  and its original function is no longer necessary with modern LMDB. Reported
  by Achal Dave.

* The documentation template was updated to fix broken links. Contributed by
  Adam Chainz.

* The Travis CI build configuration was heavily refactored by Alexander Zhukov.
  Automated tests are running under Travis CI once more.

* The CPython extension module did not define __all__. It is now defined
  contain the same names as on CFFI.

* Both implementations were updated to remove lmdb.open() from __all__,
  ensuring "from lmdb import *" does not shadow the builtin open(). The
  function can still be invoked using its fully qualified name, and the alias
  "Environment" may be used when "from lmdb import *" is used. Reported by
  Alexander Zhukov.

* The CPython extension exported BadRSlotError, instead of BadRslotError. The
  exception's name was corrected to match CFFI.

* Environment.open_db() now supports integerdup=True, dupfixed=True, and
  integerkey=True flags. Based on a patch by Jonathan Heyman.


2016-07-11 v0.90

* This release was deleted from PyPI due to an erroneous pull request
  upgrading the bundled LMDB to mdb.master.


2016-02-12 v0.89

* LMDB 0.9.18 is bundled.

* CPython Iterator.next() was incorrectly defined as pointing at the
  implementation for Cursor.next(), triggering a crash if the method was ever
  invoked manually. Reported by Kimikazu Kato.


2016-01-24 v0.88

* LMDB 0.9.17 is bundled.

* Transaction.id() is exposed.

* Binary wheels are built for Python 3.5 Windows 32/64-bit.


2015-08-11 v0.87

* Environment.set_mapsize() was added to allow runtime adjustment of the
  environment map size.

* Remove non-determinism from setup.py, to support Debian's reproducible
  builds project. Patch by Chris Lamb.

* Documentation correctness and typo fixes. Patch by Gustav Larsson.

* examples/keystore: beginnings of example that integrates py-lmdb with an
  asynchronous IO loop.


2015-06-07 v0.86

* LMDB_FORCE_SYSTEM builds were broken by the GIL/page fault change. This
  release fixes the problem.

* Various cosmetic fixes to documentation.


2015-06-06 v0.85

* New exception class: lmdb.BadDbiError.

* Environment.copy() and Environment.copyfd() now support compact=True, to
  trigger database compaction while copying.

* Various small documentation updates.

* CPython set_range_dup() and set_key_dup() both invoked MDB_GET_BOTH, however
  set_range_dup() should have instead invoked MDB_GET_BOTH_RANGE. Fix by
  Matthew Battifarano.

* lmdb.tool module was broken on Win32, since Win32 lacks signal.SIGWINCH. Fix
  suggested by David Khess.

* LMDB 0.9.14 is bundled along with extra fixes from mdb.RE/0.9 (release
  engineering) branch.

* CPython previously lacked a Cursor.close() method. Problem was noticed by
  Jos Vos.

* Several memory leaks affecting the CFFI implementation when running on
  CPython were fixed, apparent only when repeatedly opening and discarding a
  large number of environments. Noticed by Jos Vos.

* The CPython extension previously did not support weakrefs on Environment
  objects, and the implementation for Transaction objects was flawed. The
  extension now correctly invalidates weakrefs during deallocation.

* Both variants now try to avoid taking page faults with the GIL held,
  accomplished by touching one byte of every page in a value during reads.
  This does not guarantee faults will never occur with the GIL held, but it
  drastically reduces the possibility. The binding should now be suitable for
  use in multi-threaded applications with databases containing >2KB values
  where the entire database does not fit in RAM.


2014-09-22 v0.84

* LMDB 0.9.14 is bundled.

* CFFI Cursor.putmulti() could crash when append=False and a key already
  existed.


2014-06-24 v0.83

* LMDB 0.9.13 is bundled along with extra fixes from upstream Git.

* Environment.__enter__() and __exit__() are implemented, allowing
  Environments to behave like context managers.

* Cursor.close(), __enter__() and __exit__() are implemented, allowing Cursors
  to be explicitly closed. In CFFI this mechanism *must* be used when many
  cursors are used within a single transaction, otherwise a resource leak will
  occur.

* Dependency tracking in CFFI is now much faster, especially on PyPy, however
  at a cost: Cursor use must always be wrapped in a context manager, or
  .close() must be manually invoked for discarded Cursors when the parent
  transaction is long lived.

* Fixed crash in CFFI Cursor.putmulti().


2014-05-26 v0.82

* Both variants now implement max_spare_txns, reducing the cost of creating a
  read-only transaction 4x for an uncontended database and by up to 20x for
  very read-busy environments. By default only 1 read-only transaction is
  cached, adjust max_spare_txns= parameter if your script operates multiple
  simultaneous read transactions.

* Patch from Vladimir Vladimirov implementing MDB_NOLOCK.

* The max_spare_iters and max_spare_cursors parameters were removed, neither
  ever had any effect.

* Cursor.putmulti() implemented based on a patch from Luke Kenneth Casson
  Leighton. This function moves the loop required to batch populate a
  database out of Python and into C.

* The bundled LMDB 0.9.11 has been updated with several fixes from upstream
  Git.

* The cost of using keyword arguments in the CPython extension was
  significantly reduced.


2014-04-26 v0.81

* On Python 2.x the extension module would silently interpret Unicode
  instances as buffer objects, causing UCS-2/UCS-4 string data to end up in
  the database. This was never intentional and now raises TypeError. Any
  Unicode data passed to py-lmdb must explicitly be encoded with .encode()
  first.

* open_db()'s name argument was renamed to key, and its semantics now match
  get() and put(): in other words the key must be a bytestring, and passing
  Unicode will raise TypeError.

* The extension module now builds under Python 3.4 on Windows.


2014-04-21 v0.80

* Both variants now build successfully as 32 bit / 64bit binaries on
  Windows under Visual Studio 9.0, the compiler for Python 2.7. This enables
  py-lmdb to be installed via pip on Windows without requiring a compiler to
  be available. In future, .egg/.whl releases will be pre-built for all recent
  Python versions on Windows.

  Known bugs: Environment.copy() and Environment.copyfd() currently produce a
  database that cannot be reopened.

* The lmdb.enable_drop_gil() function was removed. Its purpose was
  experimental at best, confusing at worst.


2014-03-17 v0.79

* CPython Cursor.delete() lacked dupdata argument, fixed.

* Fixed minor bug where CFFI _get_cursor() did not note its idea of
  the current key and value were up to date.

* Cursor.replace() and Cursor.pop() updated for MDB_DUPSORT databases. For
  pop(), the first data item is popped and returned. For replace(), the first
  data item is returned, and all duplicates for the key are replaced.

* Implement remaining Cursor methods necessary for working with MDB_DUPSORT
  databases: next_dup(), next_nodup(), prev_dup(), prev_nodup(), first_dup(),
  last_dup(), set_key_dup(), set_range_dup(), iternext_dup(),
  iternext_nodup(), iterprev_dup(), iterprev_nodup().

* The default for Transaction.put(dupdata=...) and Cursor.put(dupdata=...) has
  changed from False to True. The previous default did not reflect LMDB's
  normal mode of operation.

* LMDB 0.9.11 is bundled along with extra fixes from upstream Git.


2014-01-18 v0.78

* Patch from bra-fsn to fix LMDB_LIBDIR.

* Various inaccurate documentation improvements.

* Initial work towards Windows/Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 build.

* LMDB 0.9.11 is now bundled.

* To work around install failures minimum CFFI version is now >=0.8.0.

* ticket #38: remove all buffer object hacks. This results in ~50% slowdown
  for cursor enumeration, but results in far simpler object lifetimes. A
  future version may introduce a better mechanism for achieving the same
  performance without loss of sanity.


2013-11-30 v0.77

* Added Environment.max_key_size(), Environment.max_readers().

* CFFI now raises the correct Error subclass associated with an MDB_* return
  code.

* Numerous CFFI vs. CPython behavioural inconsistencies have been fixed.

* An endless variety of Unicode related 2.x/3.x/CPython/CFFI fixes were made.

* LMDB 0.9.10 is now bundled, along with some extra fixes from Git.

* Added Environment(meminit=...) option.


2013-10-28 v0.76

* Added support for Environment(..., readahead=False).

* LMDB 0.9.9 is now bundled.

* Many Python 2.5 and 3.x fixes were made. Future changes are automatically
  tested via Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/dw/py-lmdb>.

* When multiple cursors exist, and one cursor performs a mutation,
  remaining cursors may have returned corrupt results via key(), value(),
  or item(). Mutations are now explicitly tracked and cause the cursor's
  data to be refreshed in this case.

* setup.py was adjusted to ensure the distutils default of '-DNDEBUG' is never
  defined while building LMDB. This caused many important checks in the engine
  to be disabled.

* The old 'transactionless' API was removed. A future version may support the
  same API, but the implementation will be different.

* Transaction.pop() and Cursor.pop() helpers added, to complement
  Transaction.replace() and Cursor.replace().
